overall speedup: 1.44

challenge1: 0.93
diabolical: 0.48
extreme: 0.56
seventeen: 0.54
vegard_hanssen: 0.83
wildcat: 0.15

As can be seen in the graph par_bench.png we achieve nice parallelism
for about half the time, but the process handling the challenge1
sudoku is more than twice as long.


parallel guesses:

  {challenge1,579.6075500000001},
  {extreme,30.71952},

overall speedup: 1.26
challenge: 1.86
challenge1: 1.12
diabolical: 2.05
extreme: 0.49
seventeen: 1.00
vegard_hanssen: 2.25
wildcat: 0.94
geometric mean: 1.24

This is parallel guessing only for the first possible guesses, the
depth can be increased to yeild better results for some of the
problems (for example challenge1 can be made quicker) but it then gets
worse on other leading to a worse overall speedup.
